  I am currently a third year student studying Computer Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, with a minor in Business and French. I am actively searching for Summer 2025 internships. I hope you enjoy taking a look at my respositories from personal/academic projects over the years, and feel free to connect with me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-meli-b14861256/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>.
