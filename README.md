### Coding Experience
<p>
  I started my coding journey as a Sophomore in high school, where I took AP Computer Science Principles. This course not only introduced me to HTML and JavaScript, but also to my love for the Computer Science field. Since then I've become well versed in data structures and algorithms, and recently broke into the Artificial Intelligence world. My projects range from 3D dungeon escape games to AI Mancala players.
